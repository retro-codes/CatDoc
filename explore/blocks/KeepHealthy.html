          <p>In many ways, it helps to compare your cat to yourself. Feline anatomy is almost identical to human anatomy. Think of the things you need, think of the things you need to do or have done each day or each week for yourself. Chances are your cat needs many of the same things. However, so often, this type of routine care, preventative care, or "comfort care" is overlooked.
            <br>
            <br>
          For example, if you have a short-haired cat and think of him as low maintenance or no maintenance, think again. They still have hair, still have skin, and still have nails.
          <br>
          <br>
          You say you've known cats that have lived for 20 years and never had a bath, never had a nail trim, never had a good brush-out and they lived to a ripe old age without problems? It's possible, but those are the exception and certainly not the rule. It's also possible that the cat had discomfort you weren't aware of. Cats are very good at hiding pain.
          <br>
          <br>
          For every 20 year old cat you can tell me about that never needed grooming or teeth cleaning or any maintenance at all, I can tell you about hundreds, or more accurately, thousands that suffered and died much earlier because they didn't get preventative cat care.</p>
