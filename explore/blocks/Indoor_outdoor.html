          <p>House Cats that stay indoors exclusively are safer than outdoor cats that are exposed to many different types of dangers. However, Cristine from Georgia wrote in with an interesting question about Indoor Cats and Indoor/Outdoor Cats.
            <br>
            <br>
          Is it healthy, safe, etc to have a Indoor Cat and then an Indoor/Outdoor Cat in the same home?
          <br>
          <br>
          I have a 2 year old cat and I found she feels much safer than living outside. 
          <br>
          <br>
          And I have also compared my Cat to outdoor cat and I have observed that outdoor cats are however not afraid that much than the indoor living cats. But the problem is that The proper nutrition that an indoor cat takes, outdoor cats don't have it. And thus falls to sickness and other diseases. </p>
