          <p>Holistic Cat Medicine refers to the art and science of healing that includes the whole animal - body, mind, and spirit. Many people think that holistic medicine is in total opposition to tradition medicine, but that is not true. Holistic medicine combines conventional therapies with complementary therapies to promote optimal health. It aims to prevent and treat disease processes by addressing all contributing factors.
            <br><br>
            This means that disease is viewed as the result of all factors, physical, emotional, spiritual, social and environmental. If disease is caused by all of these things, then treatment must be aimed at all, as well.
            <br><br>The AHVMA (American Holistic Veterinary Medicine Association) defines holistic veterinary care best:
            <br><br>"Holistic medicine, by its very nature, is humane to the core. The wholeness of its scope will set up a lifestyle for the animal that is most appropriate. The techniques used in holistic medicine are gentle, minimally invasive, and incorporate patient well-being and stress reduction. Holistic thinking is centered on love, empathy and respect."
            <br><br>As a cat owner, you need to be a very good observer to find out if your feline companion is suffering from a painful condition. Cats don't show signs of pain in the same way dogs do!Often you will recognize signs of pain only as alterations in their behavior and habits: your cat might prefer to lie in warmer places, won't jump any more onto the favourite spot on the window sill or doesn't want to be stroked on certain parts of the body.</p>
